# Urban Optimizer

This module finds the optimal configuration of a sustainable mobility system that integrates bicycle trails, canals and railways. It was created at the Department of Electronics, Information, and Bioengineering (DEIB) of the Politecnico di Milano. It provides decision-makers with a tool for urban planning that takes into account all aspects of multi-modal mobility and guarantees optimality of the solution w.r.t. a user-defined criterion: minimum cost, maximum routed traffic, maximum routed origin/destination pairs, among others.

The module is implemented as a Python package that can be imported with `import urbanopti`. It can be used in conjunction with the _Urban Optimizer Plugin_, which can be accessed through QGIS.
